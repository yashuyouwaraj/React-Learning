`expect` is a function used to make **assertions** in our tests. An assertion is a statement that checks if a value meets a certain condition (like equality, truthiness, etc.). We use `expect` to check if the result of a test is what we expect it to be.

### How `expect` works:

1. **We pass a value** (the result we want to check) to `expect`.
2. **Then we call a matcher** (like `.toBe()`, `.toEqual()`, `.toBeTruthy()`) to check if the value matches our expectations.

Example:

```js
test("adds numbers correctly", () => {
  const result = 1 + 1;
  expect(result).toBe(2); // Check if result is exactly 2
});
```

In this example:

- `expect(result)` is checking the value of `result`.
- `.toBe(2)` is the matcher that checks if `result` is equal to `2`.

So, `expect` is how you write the condition you want to test in your test cases.
